// return notes.html file

// return all info w GET *

// API routes:
// GET/api/notes should read the db.json and return all saved notes as JSON

// POST / api/notes should receive new note to save on the request body, add to the db.json file, and return the new route to the client 
//      each note must have a unique id when its saved (look for npm package that could do this for me)
